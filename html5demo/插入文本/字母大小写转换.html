		<li>Along with economic development, social progress,and acceleration of urbanized  progress,people's demands to transportation have been increased and enhanced obviously.</li>
		<li>In view of this question, this paper mainly discusses how to make the improvement to the Dijkstra algorithm, and achieve the algorithm optimization.</li>
		<li>The Dijkstra algorithm is used to calculate the shortest price path from a source node to other nodes,and it produces the shortest path by the order which increases progressively according to the path length.</li>
